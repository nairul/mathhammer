# Spreadsheet TO DO
  1) Throttle hit/wound modifiers to read accurately when adding them to BS/WS would be >=1. Maybe make a new "modified chance" cell in CALC sections?  
  2) Fix triggers
  3) Fix DMG/DPP/AVG cells to only be 0 or positive

# Roadmap
  1) Correct formulas in spreadsheet and test (see above section)
  2) Create web app equivalent of spreadsheet using only index.html and main.js
    a) Wireframe
    b) Add html structure
    c) Plugin spreadsheet formulas to main.js
    d) Replicate spreadsheet graphs in HTML form. Experiment with flotjs, chartjs, or d3(?) for interactive graphs.
  3) Assess next steps. Angular? Users? Database? CSS?
